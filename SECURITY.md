## Reporting security problems to Strike

**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problem. Instead, please send an
email to security@strikeprotocols.com

For security reasons, DO NOT include attachments or provide detail sufficient for exploitation regarding the security issue in this email. Instead, wait the Strike team to contact you.

DO send the email from an email domain that is less likely to get flagged for spam by gmail. 

Expect a response as fast as possible, typically within 72 hours.

If you do not receive a response within that time frame, please do followup with the team directly.

As above, please DO NOT include attachments or provide detail regarding the security issue in this email.

## Security Bug Bounties
We pay a bug bounty at our discretion after verifying the bug. We will update this policy in the future with more specifics.

This bounty is only paid out if details about the security issues have not been provided to third parties before a fix has been introduced and verified.

Furthermore, the reporter is in no way allowed to exploit the issue without our explicit consent.
